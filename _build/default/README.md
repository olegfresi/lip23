# ðŸ¤– LIP23 project: CROBOTS ðŸ¤–

Define the parser and the small-step semantics of small battle robots competing in the programming game [CROBOTS](https://crobots.deepthought.it/home.php).

In order to make the project work you'll need to:
- define a lexer in `lib/lexer.mll`
- define a parser in `lib/parser.mly`
- implement the interfaces `lib/memory.mli` and `lib/trace.mli`
- *(optional)* if you modified the signatures of the interfaces above (for example, you changed the signature of `trace1_expr` to return a `Ast.expression * state`), adapt the marked code in `bin/main.ml`

## Run the project

Run the project with two sample robots:

```bash
dune exec crobots test/rabbit test/rook
```

You should see the following output:

```
test/rabbit compiled with no errors.
test/rook compiled with no errors.
test/rabbit was hit by test/rook's missile (D%: 11)
test/rabbit was hit by test/rook's missile (D%: 16)
test/rabbit was hit by test/rook's missile (D%: 20)
test/rook hit east wall (D%: 5)
test/rabbit was hit by test/rook's missile (D%: 32)
test/rabbit was hit by test/rook's missile (D%: 42)
test/rook hit west wall (D%: 10)

test/rabbit was hit by test/rook's missile (D%: 83)
test/rabbit was hit by test/rook's missile (D%: 89)
test/rabbit was hit by test/rook's missile (D%: 94)
test/rabbit was hit by test/rook's missile (D%: 100)
test/rabbit was killed by test/rook's missile
test/rook is the winner
```

## Run tests
